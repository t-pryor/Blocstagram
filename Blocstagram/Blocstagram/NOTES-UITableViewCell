UITableViewCell

In a table cell, we don't add subviews to self, we add them to self.contentView
A UITableViewCell supports accessory views, located on the right edge of a UITableViewCell
You can display any one of these five types by setting the accessoryStyle property

Editing Mode
A table view may be entered into an "editing mode" by invoking setEditing:animated on UITableView

CELL STYLING
Attributed strings are neither string objects nor a subclass of NSString
An NSAttributedString is more than a collection of characters: it also provides appearance attributes for those characters. (italicize, bold, colore etc)
Attributed strings let us perform these rich-text modifications for presentation in iOS.
